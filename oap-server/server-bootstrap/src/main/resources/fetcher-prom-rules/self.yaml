# This will parse a textual representation of a duration. The formats
# accepted are based on the ISO-8601 duration format {@code PnDTnHnMn.nS}
# with days considered to be exactly 24 hours.
# <p>
# Examples:
# <pre>
#    "PT20.345S" -- parses as "20.345 seconds"
#    "PT15M"     -- parses as "15 minutes" (where a minute is 60 seconds)
#    "PT10H"     -- parses as "10 hours" (where an hour is 3600 seconds)
#    "P2D"       -- parses as "2 days" (where a day is 24 hours or 86400 seconds)
#    "P2DT3H4M"  -- parses as "2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes"
#    "P-6H3M"    -- parses as "-6 hours and +3 minutes"
#    "-P6H3M"    -- parses as "-6 hours and -3 minutes"
#    "-P-6H+3M"  -- parses as "+6 hours and -3 minutes"
