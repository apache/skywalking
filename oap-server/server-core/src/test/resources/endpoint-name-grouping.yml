# Endpoint name grouping rules.
# In most cased, endpoint name should be detected by agents or service mesh automatically, and aggregate the metrics based
# on the name.
# But, in some cases, application puts the parameter in the endpoint name, such as putting order id in the URI, like
# /prod/ORDER123, /prod/ORDER456.
# This grouping file provides the regex based definition capability to merge those endpoints into a group by better and
# more meaningful aggregation metrics.

grouping:
  # Endpoint of the service would follow the following rules
  - service-name: serviceA
    rules:
      - endpoint-name: /prod/{id}
        regex: \/prod\/.+
