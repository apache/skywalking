# Use Groovy script to define the matching rules, the input parameters are the upper service(u) and the lower service(l) and the return value is a boolean.

  # the name of the upper service is equal to the name of the lower service
  name: "{ (u, l) -> u.name == l.name }"

  # The hierarchy level of the service layer, the level is used to define the order of the service layer for UI presentation.
