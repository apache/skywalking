# This file is used to configure the TopN rules for BanyanDB in SkyWalking OAP server.
# The rules define how to aggregate and sort `metrics (Measure)` for services, endpoints, and instances.
#
# - name: Required. The name of the TopN rule, uniquely identifies the rule.
# - metricName: Required. The name of the metric to be aggregated.
# - groupByTagNames: Optional, default `[]`. The tag names to group the metrics by. If not specified, the metrics will sort without grouped.
# - countersNumber: Optional, default `1000`. The max size of entries in a time window for the pre-aggregation.

# The size of LRU determines the maximally tolerated time range.
# The buffers in the time range are kept in the memory so that
# the data in [T - lruSize * n, T] would be accepted in the pre-aggregation process.
# T = the current time in the current dimensionality.
# n = interval in the current dimensionality.
# - lruSizeMinute: Optional, default `10`. Defines how many time_buckets are held in the memory for minute-level metrics.
# - lruSizeHourDay: Optional, default `2`. Defines how many time_buckets are held in the memory for hour and day-level metrics.

# - sort: Optional, default `all`. The sorting order for the metrics, asc, des or all(include both asc and des).
# - excludes: Optional, default `[]`. The tag values to be excluded from the candidates. If specified, the candidates will not include the entries with the specified tag values.
