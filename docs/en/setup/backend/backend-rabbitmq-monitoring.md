# RabbitMQ monitoring

SkyWalking leverages `rabbitmq_prometheus` plugin for collecting metrics data from RabbitMQ. It leverages OpenTelemetry
Collector to transfer the metrics to
[OpenTelemetry receiver](opentelemetry-receiver.md) and into the [Meter System](./../../concepts-and-designs/meter.md).

## Data flow

1. The `rabbitmq_prometheus` plugin collect metrics data from RabbitMQ. Note: The RabbitMQ version is required to be
   3.8.0+.
   The `rabbitmq_prometheus` plugin is built-in since RabbitMQ v3.8.0.
2. OpenTelemetry Collector fetches metrics from `rabbitmq_prometheus` plugin via Prometheus Receiver and pushes metrics
   to
   SkyWalking OAP Server via OpenTelemetry gRPC exporter.
3. The SkyWalking OAP Server parses the expression with [MAL](../../concepts-and-designs/mal.md) to
   filter/calculate/aggregate and store the results.

## Setup

1. Setup [rabbitmq_prometheus](https://www.rabbitmq.com/prometheus.html#installation).
2. Set up [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/#kubernetes). The example
   for OpenTelemetry Collector configuration, refer
   to [here](../../../../test/e2e-v2/cases/rabbitmq/otel-collector-config.yaml).
3. Config SkyWalking [OpenTelemetry receiver](opentelemetry-receiver.md).

## RabbitMQ Monitoring

RabbitMQ monitoring provides multidimensional metrics monitoring of RabbitMQ cluster as `Layer: RABBITMQ` `Service` in
the OAP. In each cluster, the nodes are represented as `Instance`.
