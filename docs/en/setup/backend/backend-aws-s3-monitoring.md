# AWS Cloud S3 monitoring
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service. SkyWalking leverages [AWS Kinesis Data Firehose receiver](./aws-firehose-receiver.md) to transfer the CloudWatch metrics of s3 to
[OpenTelemetry receiver](opentelemetry-receiver.md) and into the [Meter System](./../../concepts-and-designs/mal.md).

### Data flow
1. AWS CloudWatch collect metrics for S3, refer to [S3 monitoring with CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cloudwatch-monitoring.html)
2. [CloudWatch metric streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metric-Streams.html) stream CloudWatch metrics of S3 to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose
3. AWS Kinesis Data Firehose delivery metrics to [AWS Kinesis Data Firehose receiver](./aws-firehose-receiver.md) through the HTTP endpoint

### Set up
1. Create CloudWatch metrics configuration for S3, refer to [S3 metrics configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/metrics-configurations.html)
2. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream, and set [AWS Kinesis Data Firehose receiver](./aws-firehose-receiver.md)'s address as HTTP(s) Destination, refer to [Create Delivery Stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/basic-create.html)
3. Create CloudWatch metric stream, and select the Firehose Delivery Stream which has been created above, set `Select namespaces` to `AWS/S3`, `Select output format` to `OpenTelemetry 0.7`. refer to [CloudWatch Metric Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metric-Streams.html)
