# Backend storage
The SkyWalking storage is pluggable. We have provided the following storage solutions, which allow you to easily
use one of them by specifying it as the `selector` in `application.yml`ï¼š

```yaml
storage:
  selector: ${SW_STORAGE:banyandb}
```

Natively supported storage:

## BanyanDB - Native APM Database
- [BanyanDB](storages/banyandb.md)

It has demonstrated significant potential in performance improvement. It indicates 5x less memory usage, 
1/5 disk IOPS, 1/4 disk throughput, and 30% less disk space, albeit with a slightly higher CPU trade-off, compared to Elasticsearch.
It is designed and implemented natively for SkyWalking use cases.

## SQL database
- [MySQL and its compatible databases](storages/mysql.md)
- [PostgreSQL and its compatible databases](storages/postgresql.md)

MySQL and PostgreSQL are recommended for production environments for medium scale deployments, especially for low trace
and log sampling rate. Some of their compatible databases may support larger scale better, such as TiDB and AWS Aurora.

## Elasticsearch+

- [OpenSearch](storages/elasticsearch.md#opensearch)
- [ElasticSearch 7 and 8](storages/elasticsearch.md#elasticsearch)

Elasticsearch and OpenSearch are recommended for production environments, specially for large scale deployments.
OpenSearch derived from Elasticsearch 7.10.2 and iterate by its own roadmap.
