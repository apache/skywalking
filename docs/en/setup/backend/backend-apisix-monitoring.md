# APISIX monitoring
## APISIX  performance from `apisix prometheus plugin`
SkyWalking leverages OpenTelemetry Collector to transfer the metrics to
[OpenTelemetry receiver](opentelemetry-receiver.md) and into the [Meter System](./../../concepts-and-designs/mal.md).

### Data flow
1. [APISIX Prometheus plugin](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/prometheus/) collects metrics data from APSIX.
2. OpenTelemetry Collector fetches metrics from [APISIX Prometheus plugin](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/prometheus/) via Prometheus Receiver and pushes metrics to SkyWalking OAP Server via OpenTelemetry gRPC exporter.
3. The SkyWalking OAP Server parses the expression with [MAL](../../concepts-and-designs/mal.md) to filter/calculate/aggregate and store the results.

### Set up
1. Enable APISIX [APISIX Prometheus plugin](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/prometheus/) .
2. Set up [OpenTelemetry Collector ](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/#docker). For details on Prometheus Receiver in OpenTelemetry Collector, refer to [here](../../../../test/e2e-v2/cases/apisix/otel-collector/otel-collector-config.yaml).
3. Config SkyWalking [OpenTelemetry receiver](opentelemetry-receiver.md).

### APISIX Monitoring
[APISIX prometheus plugin](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/prometheus/) provide multiple dimensions metrics for APISIX server , upstream , route , etc. 
Accordingly, SkyWalking observes the status, payload, and latency of the APISIX server, which is cataloged as a `LAYER: APISIX` `Service` in the OAP. Meanwhile, the instances would be recognized as `LAYER: APISIX` `instance`s. The route rules and nodes would be recognized as `endpoint`s with `route/` and `upstream/` prefixes.

#### Specify SkyWalking Service name  

SkyWalking expects OTEL Collector attribute `skywalking_service` to be the `Service` name.

Make sure `skywalking_service` attribute exists through `static_configs` of OTEL Prometheus scape config.

```yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config: 
     scrape_configs:
       - job_name: 'apisix-monitoring' 
         static_configs:
           - targets: ['apisix:9091']
             labels:
               skywalking_service: exmple_service_name  # Specify SkyWalking Service name              
```

You also could leverage OTEL Collector processor to add `skywalking_service` attribute , as following :

```yaml      
processors:
  resource/skywalking-service:
    attributes:
    - key: skywalking_service   
      value: exmple_service_name # Specify Skywalking Service name 
      action: insert                     
```
Notice , if you don't specify `skywalking_service` attribute, SkyWalking OAP would use `APISIX` as the default service name
