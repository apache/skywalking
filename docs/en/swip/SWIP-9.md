# Support Flink Monitoring
## Motivation
Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Now that Skywalking can monitor OpenTelemetry metrics, I want to add Flink monitoring via the OpenTelemetry Collector, which fetches metrics from its own Http Endpoint
to expose metrics data for Prometheus.

## Architecture Graph
There is no significant architecture-level change.

## Proposed Changes
Flink expose its metrics via HTTP endpoint to OpenTelemetry collector, using SkyWalking openTelemetry receiver to receive these metricsã€‚
Provide cluster, instance, and endpoint dimensions monitoring.
