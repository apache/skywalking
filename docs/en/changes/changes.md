## 10.3.0

#### Project

* Bump up BanyanDB dependency version(server and java-client) to 0.9.0.
* Fix CVE-2025-54057, restrict and validate url for widgets.
* Fix `MetricsPersistentWorker`, remove DataCarrier queue from `Hour/Day` dimensions metrics persistent process.
  This is important to reduce memory cost and `Hour/Day` dimensions metrics persistent latency.

#### OAP Server

* BanyanDB: Support `hot/warm/cold` stages configuration.
* Fix query continues profiling policies error when the policy is already in the cache.
* Support `hot/warm/cold` stages TTL query in the status API and graphQL API.
* PromQL Service: traffic query support `limit` and regex match.
* Fix an edge case of HashCodeSelector(Integer#MIN_VALUE causes ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException).
* Support Flink monitoring.
* BanyanDB: Support `@ShardingKey` for Measure tags.
* BanyanDB: Support cold stage data query for metrics/traces/logs.
* Increase the idle check interval of the message queue to 200ms to reduce CPU usage under low load conditions.
* Limit max attempts of DNS resolution of Istio ServiceEntry to 3, and do not wait for first resolution result in case the DNS is not resolvable at all.
* Support analysis waypoint metrics in Envoy ALS receiver.
* Add Ztunnel component in the topology.
* [Break Change] Change `compomentId` to `componentIds` in the K8SServiceRelation Scope. 
* Adapt the mesh metrics if detect the ambient mesh in the eBPF access log receiver.
* Add JSON format support for the `/debugging/config/dump` status API.
* Enhance status APIs to support multiple `accept` header values, e.g. `Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8`.
* Storage: separate `SpanAttachedEventRecord` for SkyWalking trace and Zipkin trace.
* [Break Change]BanyanDB: Setup new Group policy.
* Bump up commons-beanutils to 1.11.0.
* Refactor: simplify the `Accept` http header process.
* [Break Change]Storage: Move `event` from metrics to records.
* Remove string limitation in Jackson deserializer for ElasticSearch client.
* Fix `disable.oal` does not work.
* Enhance the stability of e2e PHP tests and update the PHP agent version.
* Add component ID for the `dameng` JDBC driver.
* BanyanDB: Support custom `TopN pre-aggregation` rules configuration in file `bydb-topn.yml`.
* refactor: implement OTEL handler with SPI for extensibility.
* chore: add `toString` implementation for `StorageID`.
* chore: add a warning log when connecting to ES takes too long.
* Fix the query time range in the metadata API.
* OAP gRPC-Client support `Health Check`.
* [Break Change] `health_check_xx` metrics make response 1 represents healthy, 0 represents unhealthy.
* Bump up grpc to 1.70.0.
* BanyanDB: support new Index rule type `SKIPPING/TREE`, and update the record `log`'s `trace_id` indexType to `SKIPPING`
* BanyanDB: remove `index-only` from tag setting.
* Fix analysis tracing profiling span failure in ES storage.
* Add UI dashboard for Ruby runtime metrics.
* Tracing Query Execution HTTP APIs: make the argument `service layer` optional.
* GraphQL API: metadata, topology, log and trace support query by name.
* [Break Change] MQE function `sort_values` sorts according to the aggregation result and labels rather than the simple time series values.
* Self Observability: add `metrics_aggregation_queue_used_percentage` and `metrics_persistent_collection_cached_size` metrics for the OAP server.
* Optimize metrics aggregate/persistent worker: separate `OAL` and `MAL` workers and consume pools. The dataflow signal drives the new MAL consumer, 
  the following table shows the pool sizeï¼Œdriven mode and queue size for each worker.
  
| Worker                        | poolSize                                 | isSignalDrivenMode | queueChannelSize | queueBufferSize |

| MetricsAggregateMALWorker     | availableProcessors * 2 / 8, at least 1  | true               | 1                | 1000            |
| MetricsPersistentMinOALWorker | availableProcessors * 2 / 8, at least 1  | false              | 1                | 2000            |

* Bump up netty to 4.2.4.Final.
* Bump up commons-lang to 3.18.0.
* BanyanDB: support group `replicas` and `user/password` for basic authentication.
* BanyanDB: fix Zipkin query missing tag `QUERY`.
* Fix `IllegalArgumentException: Incorrect number of labels`, tags in the `LogReportServiceHTTPHandler` and `LogReportServiceGrpcHandler` inconsistent with `LogHandler`.
* BanyanDB: fix Zipkin query by `annotationQuery`
* HTTP Server: Use the default shared thread pool rather than creating a new event loop thread pool for each server. Remove the `MAX_THREADS` from each server config.
* Optimize all Armeria HTTP Server(s) to share the `CommonPools` for the whole JVM.
  In the `CommonPools`, the max threads for `EventLoopGroup` is `processor * 2`, and for `BlockingTaskExecutor` is `200` and can be recycled if over the keepAliveTimeMillis (60000L by default).
