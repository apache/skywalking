## 10.2.0

#### Project
* Add [`doc_values`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/doc-values.html) for fields
  that need to be sorted or aggregated in Elasticsearch, and disable all others.
  * This change would not impact the existing deployment and its feature for our official release users.
  * **Warning** If there are custom query plugins for our Elasticsearch indices, this change could break them as
    sort queries and aggregation queries which used the unexpected fields are being blocked.
* [Breaking Change] Rename `debugging-query` module to `status-query` module. Relative exposed APIs are **UNCHANGED**. 
* [Breaking Change] All jars of the `skywalking-oap-server` are no longer published through maven central. We will only 
  publish the source tar and binary tar to the website download page, and docker images to docker hub.
  * **Warning** If you are using the `skywalking-oap-server` as a dependency in your project, you need to download the 
    source tar from the website and publish them to your private maven repository.
* [Breaking Change] Remove H2 as storage option permanently. BanyanDB 0.8(OAP 10.2 required) is easy, stable and 
  production-ready. Don't need H2 as default storage anymore.

#### OAP Server
