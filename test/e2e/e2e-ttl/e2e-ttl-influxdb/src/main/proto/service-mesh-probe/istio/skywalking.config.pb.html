<p>The SkyWalking adapter uses the <code>Istio bypass</code> adapter to collect metrics and make them available to
<a href="https://skywalking.apache.org/">Apache SkyWalking</a>. SkyWalking provides a topology map and metrics graph 
to visualize the whole mesh.</p>

<p>This adapter supports the <a href="https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/templates/metric/">metric template</a>.</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/docs/README.md">official Apache SkyWalking documentation</a> 
and <a href="https://github.com/apache/skywalking-kubernetes">SkyWalking k8s documentation</a> for details on configuring SkyWalking and the Istio bypass adapter.</p>
