SkyWalking: APM (application performance monitor) tool for distributed systems,
especially designed for microservices, cloud native and container-based (Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos) architectures.
Underlying technology is a distributed tracing system.

SkyWalking provides a high performance Java agent, lets the users don't need to change any source codes for instrumentation
and distributed tracing.
At the same time, SkyWalking provides backend, including collector and UI, to aggregate, analysis metrics and traces.
In order to visualize the performance data, distributed traces, application topology and alarms.

SkyWalking "Trace Data Protocol" and "Cross Process Propagation Headers Protocol" open for any other agent implementors, e.g. other language agent or SDK. You can use
You can use our backend to analysis and visualize your data, even can interop your agent/SDK with SkyWalking Java agent.
